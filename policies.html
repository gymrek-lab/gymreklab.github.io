<h3>Publication policy</h3>

<p>
Our scientific mission is to determine and interpret genetic causes of human disease. We do this largely based on public funding, and thus are obligated to share the outcomes and benefits of our work with the public as soon as possible. In line with the principles described in the <a href="https://www.atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/PubPolicy">ATGU Publication Policy</a>, our group is committed to making our work available as freely and rapidly as possible. 
</p>

<p>
To support this mission, we make the following pledges for any studies led primarily by our group:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Deposit all manuscripts on preprint servers at the time of submission.</li>
<li>Only submit to journals that allow free and immediate access to the final work.</li>
<li>Encourage our co-authors and colleagues to do the same.</li>
</ul>
