Ordering Pizza for the Lab
==========================

Who should I buy pizza from?
----------------------------
I've been using Domino's. It can be hard for delivery drivers to find you on UCSD's campus, but Domino's has a dropdown menu with every building on campus! You can even enter the exact room number, but it's probably easier if you just tell them to deliver to the nearest street or parking lot. You should specify those details in the delivery notes.
If you order with Domino's, make sure to look for coupon codes on their website. There's usually one for 20% off.

How many pizzas should I buy?
-----------------------------
For a party of 15, I usually buy 5-6 large pizzas, but if you're purchasing for a lot more people, you might want to aim for extra large pizzas instead.
Domino's has information about how many pizzas to order `here <https://www.dominos.com/en/about-pizza/how-many-slices-are-in-a-large-pizza>`_, but it's always better to overestimate than to underestimate. I'm of the opinion that the estimates they give are always too little.
You'll get more "bang for your buck" if you buy extra large pizzas than large pizzas. But if you buy extra large pizzas, be aware of the fact that people will often eat more than if you bought large pizzas -- just because the slices are larger. Also, the extra large pizzas are usually "Brooklyn style" only, which means that the dough is really thin and the toppings usually slide off the pizza when you try to take a bite. For these reasons, I almost always stick to the large pizzas for most occassions and only order extra larges for larger events.

What kinds of pizza should I buy?
---------------------------------
I aim for ratios of 3:2:1 for vegetarian : meat : regular cheese. So if I'm purchasing 6 pizzas, I get 3 vegetarian, 2 meat, and one cheese. For the meat pizzas, I try to get one chicken pizza and one pepperoni in case there are a few people who don't eat red meat / pork.
If you know that you'll need to order the pizza ahead of time, you can send out a poll to see what people like. I recommend doing this at least a day before, in case they don't see it immediately. Sending out a poll can also help you get a list of names for later when you need to request reimbursement (see below).

Should I add a tip?
-------------------
Yes. Definitely. The drivers apparently don't get reimbursed for the price of gas, so inflation has been hard on them. But the nearest Domino's store is close, so I usually give them just $5-8 (or around 8-9% of the order total).

When should I have them deliver?
--------------------------------
At least 30 (preferably, 45) minutes before the event. You never know when something will go wrong, and you'll want to leave some time to call them and reorder the pizza if they somehow lost the order. (This hasn't happened to me with Domino's yet, just other providers.)
I submit my order at least 2.5 hrs ahead of the event time. For a really large party (of 40, for example), I would make it 3 or 4 hrs ahead of time. You might even want to call them to confirm they received it and can handle it, especially for such a large group.

If you have the ability to park on campus then it might be easier to just pick it up from them. I have never done this myself, though.

What should I do prior to the event?
------------------------------------
Watch for phone calls! They usually call a couple minutes before the delivery to confirm the delivery location.
If you don't answer your phone and/or they can't find you at the designated location, they will simply cancel the delivery. They are on a tight schedule and will have limited patience for you.
Be aware that they might deliver early or late. At most, I've seen them deliver 20 minutes early or 40 minutes late.
Also, call them ahead of time to see if they can deliver plates and knapkins. They usually don't have plates -- in which case, you can use some of the paper plates in the cupboards of the kitchen. You can ask Dorit to buy new paper plates (every couple months).

How do I get reimbursed?
------------------------
Email Dorit at gymreklab-help@googlegroups.com with a PDF of your receipt as well as a list of each person who ate pizza and their titles (ex: "Graduate Student", "Professor", "Postdoc", etc). She will enter the receipt into UCSD's Concur system, which will route your reimbursement through four or five different people at UCSD who will need to approve it. The first time this is done, you will first need to consent to having her submit reimbursements on your behalf via Concur as described `here <https://support.ucsd.edu/finance?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0031969&sys_kb_id=dbdb7b3e1b183810506f64e8624bcbd8>`_.
