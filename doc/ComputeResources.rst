Lab Compute Resources
=====================

We use three primary compute resources. Our local server (snorlax) is used for smaller compute jobs and every day coding, data exploration, etc. TSCC is a shared compute cluster at UCSD where we run larger jobs, especially those involving large datasets that we share with UCSD collaborators. For large jobs where the data is already available on Amazon, we use Amazon Web Services. If you're just getting started, you'll probably mostly be using snorlax at first.
