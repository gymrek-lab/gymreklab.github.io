Slack overview
--------------

We use slack for most day-to-day communication. Note, it's best to put longer discussions, and any files you don't want to lose, in emails. Since we don't have a paid subscription, we can only see the latest 10,000 messages. And 10K messages actually goes by pretty fast (like in a year or so).

There are many channels on slack. Most are for specific projects that you will be added to as needed. But the following public channels are particularly useful:

* "general" is for general lab announcements. For example, to celebrate papers and birthdays.

* "computing" for questions/discussion about snorlax or other compute resources

* "gymreklab-journalclub" is for discussions of interesting papers

* "gymreklab-trainees" is specifically for trainee related discussions

* "students" top secret students socializing channel

* "random" used to have things like free food announcements. But can be for anything you want to discuss, work related or not.
