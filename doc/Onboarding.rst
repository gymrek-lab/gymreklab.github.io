Onboarding
==========

If you are new to the group, this page has a list of things you should do to get set up with helpful lab resources.

* Get an account on our lab server, :ref:`Snorlax <snorlax>`. 

* Request permission to join the "Gymrek Lab" google calendar and our mailing list gymrek-lab AT googlegroups DOT com. 

* Request an account on our slack channels (https://gymreklab.slack.com/ and https://cpg-collaboratory.slack.com)

* Take a look at :ref:`the schedule for lab meetings <labmeetings-schedule>` to note when you or others are presenting research talks or journal clubs.

* Request access to our shared Google Drive where you can find additional resources.

* If you will be working in the wet lab, please see the :ref:`wetlab onboarding page <wetlab>`.

To request access to any of these resources, email gymreklab-help AT googlegroups DOT com and someone will help you out.

You should also add a picture of yourself to `the lab website <https://gymreklab.com/people>`_! Just follow :ref:`these directions <labwebsite-add-your-photo>`. Note that this process should automatically give you access to our `Github organization <https://github.com/gymrek-lab>`_, as well.

.. TODO: set up lab website PRs to automatically give access to the org

Finally, you should request badge access to our lab by filling out `this form <https://ucsd.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4SB1zEZdwfLeljE>`_. You should mark that you are requesting access to our collaboratory, the "Center for Precision Genomics" (CPG).


Slack overview
--------------

We use slack for most day-to-day communication. Note, it's best to put longer discussions, and any files you don't want to lose, in emails. Since we don't have a paid subscription, we can only see the latest 10,000 messages. And 10K messages actually goes by pretty fast (like in a year or so).

There are many channels on slack. Most are for specific projects that you will be added to as needed. But the following public channels are particularly useful:

* "general" is for general lab announcements. For example, to celebrate papers and birthdays.

* "computing" for questions/discussion about snorlax or other compute resources

* "gymreklab-journalclub" is for discussions of interesting papers

* "gymreklab-trainees" is specifically for trainee related discussions

* "students" top secret students socializing channel

* "random" used to have things like free food announcements. But can be for anything you want to discuss, work related or not.

* "food" for announcing free food and surveying preferences when catering for an event
