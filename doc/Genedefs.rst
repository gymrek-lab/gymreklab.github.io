Obtaining gene annotations
==========================

We often need to perform analyses where we restrict to certain gene regions, such as us coding regions, UTRs, introns, etc.

UCSC
----

One way to obtain BED files (chrom, start, end) with coordinates of certain gene annotations is through the UCSC Genome Browser's Table Browser tool (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables). This tool allows you to download tons of different annotations, not just gene annotations.

To obtain gene info for your species/genome build of interest:

1. Set clade/genome/assembly to the appropriate values. e.g. Clade=Mammal, genome=Human, assembly=GRCh37/hg19 for the hg19 reference genome.

2. Set group="Genes and gene predictions" and track="UCSC Genes" (or you may be using another gene annotation. Gencode or Refseq are commonly used).

3. Set table="knownGene"

4. Select "genome" for region.

5. (important!) Set output format="custom track". Important for step 7.

6. Set "output file" to the filename you want to save results to.

7. Click "get output". This will bring you to a hidden page where you can select which regions you want included in the output file. e.g. you may select coding, exons, 5'UTR, 3'UTR, etc. Note "exons" includes UTRs. If you only want coding regions, be sure to select "coding exons" only.

8. Click "get custom track in file", which should output the file to your desired filename.

Note: there should also be a way to automate this process by connecting to the UCSC tables using mysql on the command line. e.g. bedtools documentation shows how to do this to get chromosome sizes:

.. code-block:: bash

  mysql --user=genome --host=genome-mysql.cse.ucsc.edu -A -e "select chrom, size from hg19.chromInfo" > hg19.genome

If anyone wants to update this page with mysql instructions, go for it!

Ensembl
-------

Ensembl is a genome browser from The European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI). **BioMart** (`BioMart help docs <http://uswest.ensembl.org/info/data/biomart/index.html>`_) is a data mining tool from Ensemble for exporting custom datasets. Gene annotations obtained from Ensemble should be nearly identical to those downloaded from UCSC, which serves GENCODE annotations by default. The `UCSC gene FAQ <https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQgenes.html#ens>`__ discusses this point in addition to other common questions about gene prediction and annotation. 

How can one interface with BioMart?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. `Explorer BioMart interactively <http://uswest.ensembl.org/biomart/martview>`_: great for exploring available columns, filters, filter values and building the final XML query.
#. `BiomaRt R package <https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/biomaRt.html>`_: this has a bit of a learning curve in my opinion even if one is familiar with R. 
#. `BioMart Perl API <http://uswest.ensembl.org/info/data/biomart/biomart_perl_api.html>`_
#. `BioMart RESTful access <http://uswest.ensembl.org/info/data/biomart/biomart_restful.html>`_

I find the RESTful API to be the most convenient option for downloading annotations in an automated and reproducible way. All you need is a properly formatted XML query and the unix ``wget`` utility. Queries are easy to build using the interactive portal (see above).

The `"How to use BioMart" <http://uswest.ensembl.org/info/data/biomart/how_to_use_biomart.html>`_ page has step-by-step instructions with screenshots on using the interactive interface, so I won't cover this here. Instead please see below some example queries using the RESTful API for pulling different genetic elements in mouse.

Datasets
~~~~~~~~

BioMart has four "groups" of datasets at the moment:

#. Ensemble Genes

   * Genes in available vertebrate strains (not just human and mouse).
   * ``Dataset name`` (s) (see below) are fairly predictable for each genus/species: *"mmusculus_gene_ensembl"*, *"hsapiens_gene_ensembl"*, *"rnorvegicus_gene_ensembl"*.

#. Mouse strains

   * Genes in widely used strains of mice.

#. Ensemble Variation

   * SNPs and indels in available vertebrate strains.
   * ``Dataset name`` (s) (see below) are fairly predictable for each genus/species: *"hsapiens_snp"*, *"drerio_structvar"*. Non-SNP datasets are of the form: *"ecaballus_structvar"*.

#. Ensemble Regulation

   * Datasets available for human, mouse and a single one for fruit fly.
   * Can query CTCF binding sites, enhancers, promoteres and transcription factor binding sites.

Raw data comes from ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics and Blueprint. This data is cell-type specific and is mostly ChIP-seq using histone methylation, CTCF, and DNaseI assays. Processing involves a segmentation step (ChromHMM) where signal patterns (presence/absence of methylation, DNaseI binding, CTCF binding ...) are identified across the different cell types. This leads to an assignment of states (ACTIVE, INACTIVE, REPRESSED ...) to each basepair in the genome. The signal data is available in the "Regulatory Evidence" datasets. 

In the end of the regulatory build workflow, a consensus is determined and a decision tree is used to assign "feature types". There is a separate transcription binding site annotation to supplement the regularoty regions.

For more information see: `The Ensemble Regulatory Build <http://uswest.ensembl.org/info/genome/funcgen/regulatory_build.html>`_

Queries
~~~~~~~

Each query starts with a ``<Query ... >`` tag, which defines parameters for executing the query. Below are some attributes that can be used inside this tag:

#. ``formatter``: default is TSV (CSV, HTML and XLS are other options).
#. ``header``: boolean to turn on or off.
#. ``uniqueRows``: this is equivalent to ``distinct`` in SQL when you want to remove duplicate rows.
#. ``count``: this must simply return the row count and not actual data.

The ``<Query ...>`` tag has a nested ``<Dataset ...>`` tag where the name of the dataset is defined. 

``<Attribute ...>`` tags are nested within the ``<Dataset ...>`` tag and define the columns requested from the database. A ``<Filter ...>`` (s) tag may also be specified to limit query results.

To execute a query simply submit it to the BioMart url and download the response with ``wget``.

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash
    h_string='http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martservice?query='
    query='<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE Query>
    <Query  ...
    ...
    </Query>
    '
    wget -O gene_info.tsv "${h_string}${query}"

Genes
~~~~~

Here we are querying the "mmusculus_gene_ensembl" dataset and requesting some common information like the unique Ensemble identifier, the genomic position of the gene, it's colloquial name and description. 

Because most vertebrate genes are represented by multiple transcripts, the precise definition of a "gene" is not straightforward. For an informative discussion about this see the `UCSC gene FAQ <https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQgenes.html#justsingle>`__. Even though for many applications it is unecessary to select a single representative gene, a unique list of genes can simplify certain analyses. 

The query below gives chromosome, start and end positions of the "representative" transript for each gene.

.. code-block:: xml

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE Query>
   <Query  virtualSchemaName = "default" formatter = "TSV" header = "1" uniqueRows = "0" count = "" datasetConfigVersion = "0.6" >
   	    
       <Dataset name = "mmusculus_gene_ensembl" interface = "default" >
   	    <Attribute name = "ensembl_gene_id" />
   	    <Attribute name = "external_gene_name" />
   	    <Attribute name = "gene_biotype" />
   	    <Attribute name = "strand" />
   	    <Attribute name = "chromosome_name" />
   	    <Attribute name = "start_position" />
   	    <Attribute name = "end_position" />
   	    <Attribute name = "description" />
   	    <Attribute name = "gene_biotype" />
       </Dataset>
   </Query>

Transcripts
~~~~~~~~~~~

Again we are interested in mouse genes. However, now we request the "ensembl_transcript_id" and "ensembl_exon_id" in addition to the "ensembl_gene_id". This query will return many more rows compared to the previous simplified gene query, because every transcript and every exon will be returned for each gene. 

This is the "longest" version of the table, since each transcript can contain multiple exons. Notice that BioMart can figure out that we no longer want the "representative" transcript and handles all the (likely required) table joins under the hood.

In addition to ids, we also request start and stop positions for transcripts/exons and we can also request the 5'-UTR and 3'-UTR locations. 

"Rank" refers to the ranking applied by Ensemble to determine the "representative" transcript.

The selected attributes are not an exhaustive list of ones available from BioMart. Please explore the interactive interface to find additional ones.

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE Query>
    <Query  virtualSchemaName = "default" formatter = "TSV" header = "1" uniqueRows = "0" count = "" datasetConfigVersion = "0.6" >
    	    
        <Dataset name = "mmusculus_gene_ensembl" interface = "default" >
    	<Attribute name = "ensembl_gene_id" />
    	<Attribute name = "ensembl_transcript_id" />
    	<Attribute name = "ensembl_exon_id" />
    	<Attribute name = "rank" />
    	<Attribute name = "chromosome_name" />
    	<Attribute name = "transcript_start" />
    	<Attribute name = "transcript_end" />
    	<Attribute name = "exon_chrom_start" />
    	<Attribute name = "exon_chrom_end" />
    	<Attribute name = "5_utr_start" />
    	<Attribute name = "5_utr_end" />
    	<Attribute name = "3_utr_start" />
    	<Attribute name = "3_utr_end" />
        </Dataset>
    </Query>

Introns and non-overlapping regions lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I could not find a way to directly pull coordinates of intronic regions from Ensembl. However, these coordinates can be derived. Additionally, since UTR regions are part of exons, one would need to find the intersection of the two to make a
list of regions that are exonic but *not* UTR.

* exons are entirely within transcripts
* utrs are entirely within exons
* introns: transcripts - exons
* exon-only regions: exons - utrs

`bedtools subtract <https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/subtract.html>`_ is perfect for this task. 

.. code-block:: bash

    # make a list of introns
    bedtools subtract -a transcripts.bed -b exons.bed > introns.bed
    
    # make sure there is no overlap with utrs
    bedtolls subtract -a introns.bed -b utrs.bed > tmp && mv tmp introns.bed
    
    # subtact utr regions from exons
    bedtolls subtract -a exons.bed -b utrs.bed > tmp && mv tmp exons.bed

One caveat to keep in mind is that the "transcripts" query above does not produce ``transcripts.bed``, because it contains duplicate entries for each transcript with multiple exons. To generate ``transcripts.bed``, ``utrs.bed`` and ``exons.bed``, either split the above "transcripts" query into three seprate queries or use a custom data-munging script to split the output of the "transcripts" query. Example of how to do this in R.

.. code-block:: R

    # libraries 
    library(tidyverse)
    
    # load data
    embl_transcripts = <NAME OF FILE MADE USING "TRANSCRIPTS" QUERY>
    embl_transcripts = read_tsv(embl_transcripts)
    
    # rename columns and discard blank lines
    ex_loc = embl_transcripts %>% select(ensembl_transcript_id, ensembl_exon_id, chromosome_name, exon_chrom_start, exon_chrom_end) %>%
        rename(chr = chromosome_name, pos = exon_chrom_start, end = exon_chrom_end) %>%
        filter(!is.na(pos) & !is.na(end)) %>%
        arrange(chr, pos, end)
    
    # make single entry per exon coordinate
    ex_loc = ex_loc %>% 
        group_by(chr, pos, end) %>%
        summarise(tx_id = paste0(unique(ensembl_transcript_id), collapse = ','),
    	          exon_id = paste0(unique(ensembl_exon_id), collapse = ',')) %>%
        ungroup

Phenotypes
~~~~~~~~~~

This query may not be applicable to less well studied vertebrates, but can be usefull when working with human or mouse data. 

Here we request all known phenotypes for mouse genes. Multiple rows will be returned for each gene and genes without known phenotypes will not be returned. 

This phenotype column can be a helpful "quick-look" at possible gene function, without having to search through protein databases or the literature.

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE Query>
    <Query  virtualSchemaName = "default" formatter = "TSV" header = "1" uniqueRows = "0" count = "" datasetConfigVersion = "0.6" >
    	    
        <Dataset name = "mmusculus_gene_ensembl" interface = "default" >
    	    <Attribute name = "ensembl_gene_id" />
    	    <Attribute name = "external_gene_name" />
    	    <Attribute name = "phenotype_description" />
        </Dataset>
    </Query>

Regulatory features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a simple query for regulatory elements in the mouse genome. The feature position within the genome and the feature type are requested. As an example, we have chosen to filter on "regulatory_feature_type_name", since we are only interested in some regulatory features and not others. Note that the returned features reflect the consensus across multiple tissue types. 
If you want the state of each element by tissue type, add the "epigenome_name" and "activity" attributes to the query.

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE Query>
    <Query  virtualSchemaName = "default" formatter = "TSV" header = "1" uniqueRows = "0" count = "" datasetConfigVersion = "0.6" >
    	    
        <Dataset name = "mmusculus_regulatory_feature" interface = "default" >
    	    <Filter name = "regulatory_feature_type_name" value = "CTCF Binding Site,Enhancer,Promoter,TF binding site"/>
    	    <Attribute name = "regulatory_stable_id" />
    	    <Attribute name = "chromosome_name" />
    	    <Attribute name = "chromosome_start" />
    	    <Attribute name = "chromosome_end" />
    	    <Attribute name = "feature_type_name" />
        </Dataset>
    </Query>'
